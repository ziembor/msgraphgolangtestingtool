# Version 2.6.5

## CI/CD Improvements

- Made golangci-lint non-blocking in GitHub Actions workflow
- Lint job now runs with `continue-on-error: true` to report issues without blocking builds
- Build job no longer depends on lint job, only on tests passing
- Executables are always created when tests pass, regardless of lint results
