## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- `getevents` now always logs at least one CSV entry, even when no events are found (previously logged nothing if calendar was empty)
- `getinbox` now always logs at least one CSV entry, even when no messages are found (previously logged nothing if inbox was empty)
- Both actions now log a summary entry showing total count of items retrieved

### Added
- User-friendly console output when no events/messages are found
- Summary count displayed after retrieving events or messages
