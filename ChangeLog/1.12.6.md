## [1.12.6] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed `log.Fatalf` preventing deferred cleanup causing potential CSV data loss
  - Refactored `main()` to use `run()` pattern that properly executes deferred functions
  - Replaced all `log.Fatalf` calls with proper error returns
  - `listEvents()` and `listInbox()` now return errors instead of calling `log.Fatalf`
  - CSV log file now always properly closed and flushed on exit
  - Fixes resource leak and data loss issues identified in code review

### Security
- **CRITICAL:** Added thumbprint validation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities
  - Thumbprint now validated to be exactly 40 hexadecimal characters (SHA1 hash)
  - Added `isHexString()` helper function to validate hex-only characters
  - Validation occurs before certificate store operations
  - Clear error messages for invalid thumbprint format

### Changed
- Version bump to 1.12.6
- Replaced magic strings with constants throughout codebase
  - Added `ActionGetEvents`, `ActionSendMail`, `ActionSendInvite`, `ActionGetInbox` constants
  - Added `StatusSuccess` and `StatusError` constants
  - Improved code maintainability and reduced risk of typos
  - All action names and status strings now use defined constants
