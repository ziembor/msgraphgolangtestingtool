## [1.12.4] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- `-verbose` flag for detailed diagnostic output
  - Shows all MSGRAPH* environment variables and their values (sensitive data masked)
  - Displays final configuration after environment variable processing
  - Shows authentication method and details
  - Displays JWT token information (expiration, validity period, truncated token)
  - Traces all Graph API calls with endpoints and parameters
  - Shows API response metadata
- Environment variable display in verbose mode shows which variables are active
- Created `VERSION` file at project root to track current version (single source of truth)
- Created `.claude/version-management.md` guide for version update procedures

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed environment variable `MSGRAPHTENANT` to `MSGRAPHTENANTID` for consistency
- Project structure reorganized: all Go source files moved to `src/` subdirectory
  - `msgraphgolangtestingtool.go` → `src/msgraphgolangtestingtool.go`
  - `cert_windows.go` → `src/cert_windows.go`
  - `cert_stub.go` → `src/cert_stub.go`
  - `go.mod` and `go.sum` → `src/`
- Build commands updated to use `go build -C src -o msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe`
- GitHub Actions workflow updated to build from `src/` directory
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with:
  - Build verification step
  - Automatic release notes generation
  - Explicit permissions for release creation

### Security
- Verbose mode automatically masks sensitive environment variables:
  - `MSGRAPHSECRET` - Shows first 4 and last 4 characters only
  - `MSGRAPHPFXPASS` - Fully masked
  - JWT tokens truncated to first/last 20 characters

### Documentation
- Updated all documentation to reflect `MSGRAPHTENANTID` instead of `MSGRAPHTENANT`
- Added verbose mode documentation to CLAUDE.md and README.md
- Updated build instructions for new `src/` subdirectory structure
- Added version management guidelines for future AI assistants

### Migration Guide
Update environment variable name:
```powershell
# Old (v1.12.0-1.12.3)
$env:MSGRAPHTENANT = "your-tenant-id"

# New (v1.12.4+)
$env:MSGRAPHTENANTID = "your-tenant-id"
```

Build command changes:
```powershell
# Old
go build -o msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe

# New
go build -C src -o msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe
# OR
cd src && go build -o ../msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe
```
