## [1.14.8] - 2026-01-04

### Added
- **Graceful shutdown with signal handling** (IMPROVEMENTS.md Medium Priority #2.1)
  - Added signal handling for Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and SIGTERM interrupts
  - Implemented context cancellation for graceful shutdown
  - All API operations can now be cancelled mid-execution
  - CSV logger properly closes on interrupt
  - User-friendly shutdown message displayed on interrupt
  - Imported `os/signal` and `syscall` packages

### Changed
- **Context management improvements**
  - Created single cancellable context at the start of `run()` function
  - Removed duplicate `context.Background()` calls (lines 339, 360)
  - All API operations now use the same cancellable context
  - Signal handler runs in separate goroutine monitoring for interrupts
  - Improved user experience when interrupting long-running operations

### Technical Details
- Signal channel created with buffer size of 1 for non-blocking signal delivery
- `defer cancel()` ensures context is always cancelled on function exit
- Both `GetToken()` and all Graph API operations respect context cancellation
- Graceful shutdown ensures no data loss in CSV logging
