## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-03

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Reorganized CSV column order - Status now appears immediately after Action (3rd column) for better readability
- All CSV logs now include Status column for consistency (previously missing from `getevents` and `getinbox`)
- New CSV column order: Timestamp, Action, Status, [other parameters]

### Added
- Status tracking for `getevents` and `getinbox` operations (always "Success" if operation completes)
