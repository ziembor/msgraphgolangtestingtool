## [1.12.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- Native Windows CryptoAPI (`crypt32.dll`) integration for certificate store authentication
- Support for cross-compilation (Windows-specific code isolated via build tags)

### Changed
- Removed PowerShell dependency for `-thumbprint` authentication
- Certificate export from store now happens entirely in memory (no temporary PFX files on disk)
- Project structure changed from single-file to multi-file (`cert_windows.go`, `cert_stub.go`)
