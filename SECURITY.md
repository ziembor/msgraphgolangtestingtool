## Security Assumptions and Threat Model

### Tool Design and Context

These tools (**msgraphgolangtestingtool** and **smtptool**) are designed as **diagnostic CLI utilities for authorized personnel**. Understanding the threat model is critical for proper security assessment:

**✅ Trusted Input Sources:**
- **CLI flags** (`-host`, `-subject`, `-from`, etc.) are provided by authorized users
- **Environment variables** (`SMTPHOST`, `MSGRAPHSECRET`, etc.) are set by administrators
- **Purpose**: Testing, diagnostics, troubleshooting, and automation by IT staff

**✅ Intended Usage:**
- Direct execution by authorized system administrators
- Automation scripts in controlled environments
- Testing and diagnostic workflows for email infrastructure
- Troubleshooting connectivity and authentication issues

**⚠️ NOT Designed For:**
- ❌ Accepting input from untrusted sources (web forms, public APIs, user-generated content)
- ❌ Running as a network service exposed to external requests
- ❌ Processing arbitrary user input without validation
- ❌ Public-facing interfaces or web applications

### Defense-in-Depth Measures

While CLI flags are trusted input, the tools implement defense-in-depth security measures:

**CRLF Injection Prevention (v2.0.2+):**
- All SMTP command parameters are sanitized to remove `\r` and `\n` characters
- Email headers (From, To, Subject) are sanitized before message construction
- **Note**: This is a best practice hardening measure, not a vulnerability fix

**Input Validation:**
- Email addresses validated against RFC 5322 format
- Hostnames validated for proper format
- Message IDs validated to prevent OData injection (see CVE-2026-MSGRAPH-001)

**Credential Protection (Enhanced in v2.1.0):**
- Secrets masked in verbose output (shows `secr****cret`)
- **Password masking in error messages** (v2.1.0+): Authentication failures log masked credentials
  - Format: `us****om` for usernames, `pa****rd` for passwords
  - Prevents password exposure in structured logs and error output
  - Defense-in-depth measure for log aggregation systems
- Passwords not logged in CSV files
- Tokens truncated in debug output

**Security Testing (v2.1.0):**
- **277 comprehensive unit tests** covering security-critical functions
- **100% test coverage** on key security functions:
  - `validateMessageID()` - OData injection prevention
  - `sanitizeCRLF()` - SMTP command injection prevention
  - `sanitizeEmailHeader()` - Email header injection prevention
  - `buildEmailMessage()` - RFC 5322 compliance
  - `maskPassword()` / `maskUsername()` - Credential protection
- Tests include attack patterns from OWASP Top 10, RFC violations, and real-world injection attempts
- Continuous security validation through automated testing

### Secure Deployment Guidelines

If integrating these tools into larger systems:

1. **✅ Validate External Input**: If your automation accepts input from external sources, validate it before passing to tool flags
2. **✅ Least Privilege**: Run with service accounts that have minimum required permissions
3. **✅ Access Control**: Restrict who can execute the tools using file system permissions
4. **✅ Audit Logging**: Monitor tool usage via CSV logs and Azure AD/Microsoft 365 audit logs
5. **✅ Network Security**: Use proxy settings to route traffic through monitoring systems

### Reporting Security Concerns

When reporting security issues, please provide:
- **Context**: How is the tool being used? (Direct CLI execution, web service, automation, etc.)
- **Input Source**: Where does the input come from? (Trusted admin, untrusted users, web form, etc.)
- **Attack Scenario**: Specific steps to reproduce the security concern
- **Impact Assessment**: What could an attacker achieve?

**Important**: Issues that require an attacker to already have shell access (ability to execute arbitrary commands) are generally not considered security vulnerabilities, as shell access implies code execution capabilities exceeding any tool-specific risks.

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### CVE-2026-MSGRAPH-001: OData Injection in searchAndExport (v1.21.0 - v1.21.0)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-07
**Fixed in:** v1.21.1
**Severity:** HIGH
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)

**Vulnerability Description:**

An OData injection vulnerability was discovered in the `searchAndExport` function that allowed authenticated users to bypass filter constraints and export arbitrary mailbox content. The `-messageid` parameter was directly interpolated into an OData filter string without validation or sanitization, enabling injection of malicious OData operators.

**Attack Scenario:**
```powershell
# Malicious input that bypasses filtering
./msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -action searchandexport \
    -messageid "' or 1 eq 1 or internetMessageId eq '" \
    -tenantid "..." -clientid "..." -secret "..." -mailbox "victim@example.com"

# Result: Exports entire mailbox instead of single message
```

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized access to mailbox data
- Privacy violations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Potential data breach with sensitive email content
- Filter bypass allowing targeted data exfiltration

**Affected Versions:**
- v1.21.0 (released 2026-01-06)

**Fix Details:**

The vulnerability was fixed with a defense-in-depth approach:

1. **Input Validation (Primary Defense):**
   - Added `validateMessageID()` function in `src/utils.go`
   - Enforces RFC 5322 Message-ID format: `<local@domain>`
   - Rejects quote characters (`'`, `"`, `\`)
   - Rejects OData operators (`or`, `and`, `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `gt`, `le`, `ge`, `not`)
   - Validates length (max 998 characters per RFC 5322)

2. **OData Escaping (Defense-in-Depth):**
   - Added quote escaping in `searchAndExport()` function
   - Single quotes escaped using OData escaping rules (`'` → `''`)

3. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - 30+ unit tests covering injection attempts
   - Tests validate both uppercase and lowercase operator injection
   - Tests verify RFC 5322 format enforcement

**Remediation:**
- **If using v1.21.0:** Immediately upgrade to v1.21.1 or later
- **Security Assessment:** Review CSV logs (`_msgraphgolangtestingtool_searchandexport_*.csv`) for suspicious Message-ID patterns containing quotes or OData operators
- **Audit Mailbox Access:** Check Microsoft 365 audit logs for unauthorized mailbox access between 2026-01-06 and upgrade date

# Security Best Practices

This guide outlines security best practices for using the Microsoft Graph EXO Mails/Calendar Golang Testing Tool in production environments.

## Credential Management

### Client Secrets

**Never commit secrets to source control**

```powershell
# WRONG - Secret in script file committed to Git
$secret = "very-secret-value-12345"
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -secret $secret ...

# CORRECT - Secret in environment variable or secure vault
$env:MSGRAPHSECRET = Get-Content "C:\SecureLocation\secret.txt"
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -tenantid "..." -clientid "..." -mailbox "..." -action getevents
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Store secrets in Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, or encrypted files
- ✅ Use environment variables for secrets (not command-line arguments visible in process list)
- ✅ Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- ✅ Use separate secrets for dev/test/prod environments
- ✅ Set expiration dates on secrets in Azure AD
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets in scripts
- ❌ Never commit secrets to version control (add to `.gitignore`)
- ❌ Never share secrets via email or chat

**Using Azure Key Vault:**
```powershell
# Retrieve secret from Azure Key Vault
Connect-AzAccount
$secret = (Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName "MyVault" -Name "GraphSecret").SecretValue
$env:MSGRAPHSECRET = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($secret))

# Run tool
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -tenantid "..." -clientid "..." -mailbox "..." -action getevents

# Clear secret from memory
Remove-Item Env:\MSGRAPHSECRET
```

**Using Encrypted Files (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# One-time: Create encrypted credential file
$secret = Read-Host "Enter Graph API Secret" -AsSecureString
$secret | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Out-File "C:\SecureLocation\graph-secret.enc"

# In automation script: Load encrypted credential
$encSecret = Get-Content "C:\SecureLocation\graph-secret.enc" | ConvertTo-SecureString
$plainSecret = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($encSecret))
$env:MSGRAPHSECRET = $plainSecret

# Run tool
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -tenantid "..." -clientid "..." -mailbox "..." -action getevents
```

---

### Certificates (Preferred for Production)

**Certificates are more secure than client secrets:**
- Cannot be easily copied/leaked like text secrets
- Support automatic rotation via certificate management
- Provide stronger authentication guarantees
- Can be stored in hardware security modules (HSM)

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Use certificates instead of secrets for production**
- ✅ Store certificates in Windows Certificate Store (no files on disk)
- ✅ Use strong passwords for PFX files (16+ characters, mixed case, symbols)
- ✅ Restrict file permissions on PFX files (`NTFS permissions: Administrators only`)
- ✅ Rotate certificates before expiration (set 90-day reminder)
- ✅ Use CA-signed certificates for production (not self-signed)
- ✅ Monitor certificate expiration dates
- ❌ Never store PFX files in shared network locations
- ❌ Never use weak passwords on PFX files
- ❌ Never commit PFX files to version control

**Windows Certificate Store (Most Secure):**
```powershell
# Recommended approach - certificate in Windows store, no file on disk
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -tenantid "..." -clientid "..." -thumbprint "CD817B3329802E692CF30D8DDF896FE811B048AB" -mailbox "..." -action getevents

# Benefits:
# - No certificate file on disk (reduced attack surface)
# - Private key protected by Windows security
# - Supports TPM/HSM integration
# - Automatic access control via Windows ACLs
```

**PFX File with Strong Security:**
```powershell
# If using PFX file, secure the file and password
$pfxPath = "C:\SecureLocation\cert.pfx"

# Set restrictive NTFS permissions (Administrators only)
$acl = Get-Acl $pfxPath
$acl.SetAccessRuleProtection($true, $false)  # Disable inheritance
$rule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule("BUILTIN\Administrators", "FullControl", "Allow")
$acl.SetAccessRule($rule)
Set-Acl $pfxPath $acl

# Use encrypted password
$encPass = Get-Content "C:\SecureLocation\pfx-password.enc" | ConvertTo-SecureString
$plainPass = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($encPass))
$env:MSGRAPHPFXPASS = $plainPass

# Run tool
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -tenantid "..." -clientid "..." -pfx $pfxPath -mailbox "..." -action getevents
```

**Certificate Rotation Strategy:**
```powershell
# 1. Generate new certificate before old one expires
.\selfsignedcert.ps1  # Or request from CA

# 2. Upload new certificate to Entra ID Application Registration
# (Azure Portal → App Registrations → Certificates & secrets)

# 3. Test with new certificate
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -thumbprint "NEW_THUMBPRINT" ...

# 4. Update production automation with new thumbprint
# 5. Remove old certificate from Azure AD after grace period (7-30 days)
```

## Least Privilege Principle

### API Permissions

**Only grant the minimum permissions required for your use case:**

| Action | Minimum Required Permission | Avoid Over-Permissioning |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `getevents` | `Calendars.Read` | ❌ Don't use `Calendars.ReadWrite` |
| `getinbox` | `Mail.Read` | ❌ Don't use `Mail.ReadWrite` or `Mail.ReadWrite.All` |
| `sendmail` | `Mail.Send` | ✅ Appropriate permission |
| `sendinvite` | `Calendars.ReadWrite` | ✅ Required for creating events |

**Multi-Action Scenarios:**

If you need multiple actions, grant only the necessary permissions:

```
Scenario: Read inbox and send emails
Required permissions:
  ✅ Mail.Read
  ✅ Mail.Send
  ❌ NOT Mail.ReadWrite.All (too broad)
```

**Avoid Wildcard Permissions:**
- ❌ `Mail.ReadWrite.All` - Grants access to ALL mailboxes
- ❌ `Calendars.ReadWrite.All` - Grants access to ALL calendars
- ✅ `Mail.Send` - Only allows sending (no read access)
- ✅ `Calendars.Read` - Only allows reading (no write access)

**Application vs. Delegated Permissions:**

This tool uses **Application permissions** (not Delegated):
- Application permissions work without a signed-in user
- Require admin consent
- Grant access to all mailboxes (unless restricted by Exchange policies)
- Should be monitored and audited regularly

**Restricting Application Access to Specific Mailboxes:**

Use Exchange Online Application Access Policies to limit which mailboxes the app can access:

```powershell
# Connect to Exchange Online
Connect-ExchangeOnline

# Create policy to restrict app to specific mailboxes only
New-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" -PolicyScopeGroupId "allowed-mailboxes@example.com" -AccessRight RestrictAccess -Description "Restrict Graph tool to specific mailboxes"

# Test the policy
Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity "user@example.com" -AppId "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
```

---

## Environment Variables Security

**Secure Usage:**
```powershell
# Set for current PowerShell session only (not permanent)
$env:MSGRAPHSECRET = "your-secret"
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -action getevents
Remove-Item Env:\MSGRAPHSECRET  # Clear after use

# For automation, use encrypted storage
$encSecret = Get-Content "C:\SecureLocation\secret.enc" | ConvertTo-SecureString
$env:MSGRAPHSECRET = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($encSecret))
```

**Insecure Practices to Avoid:**
```powershell
# ❌ WRONG - Sets permanent user environment variable (persists in registry)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("MSGRAPHSECRET", "secret", "User")

# ❌ WRONG - Sets permanent machine environment variable (visible to all users)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("MSGRAPHSECRET", "secret", "Machine")

# ❌ WRONG - Visible in process list and command history
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -secret "my-secret-value" ...
```

**Best Practice:**
- Use session-scoped environment variables (`$env:VAR = "value"`)
- Clear sensitive variables after use (`Remove-Item Env:\MSGRAPHSECRET`)
- Never set permanent environment variables for secrets
- Use secure credential storage (Azure Key Vault, encrypted files)

## Logging and Auditing

### CSV Logs

**What's Logged:**
- ✅ Timestamps of all operations
- ✅ Actions performed (getevents, sendmail, etc.)
- ✅ Mailbox accessed
- ✅ Email recipients (To/CC/BCC)
- ✅ Email subjects
- ✅ Success/failure status
- ❌ Secrets are NOT logged
- ❌ Email bodies are NOT logged
- ❌ Authentication tokens are NOT logged

**Log Location:**
```
%TEMP%\_msgraphgolangtestingtool_{action}_{date}.csv

Examples:
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\_msgraphgolangtestingtool_sendmail_2026-01-04.csv
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Temp\_msgraphgolangtestingtool_getevents_2026-01-04.csv
```

**Log Retention Best Practices:**
```powershell
# Review logs periodically for unauthorized usage
Get-ChildItem "$env:TEMP\_msgraphgolangtestingtool_*.csv" |
    Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending |
    Import-Csv |
    Where-Object {$_.Status -ne "Success"} |
    Format-Table

# Archive logs to secure location (retention: 90 days recommended)
$archivePath = "C:\SecureArchive\GraphToolLogs"
Get-ChildItem "$env:TEMP\_msgraphgolangtestingtool_*.csv" |
    Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)} |
    Move-Item -Destination $archivePath

# Delete old archives (after 90 days)
Get-ChildItem $archivePath |
    Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-90)} |
    Remove-Item
```

**Centralized Logging (Enterprise):**
```powershell
# Send logs to central SIEM or log aggregation system
$csvFiles = Get-ChildItem "$env:TEMP\_msgraphgolangtestingtool_*.csv"
foreach ($file in $csvFiles) {
    # Parse and send to Splunk, ELK, Azure Log Analytics, etc.
    $logs = Import-Csv $file.FullName
    # Send-LogsToSIEM -Data $logs
}
```

---

### Verbose Mode Security

**Verbose mode is safe for troubleshooting:**
- Secrets are masked (shows first/last 4 characters: `secr********cret`)
- Tokens are truncated (shows first 10 characters: `eyJ0eXAi...`)
- Full credentials are never displayed

**Example verbose output:**
```
Authentication: Client Secret (secr********cret)
Token: eyJ0eXAi... (expires in 59m 59s)
```

**When to use verbose mode:**
- ✅ Troubleshooting authentication issues
- ✅ Verifying configuration
- ✅ Debugging API call failures
- ❌ Not needed in production automation (adds overhead)

---

## Network Security

### Proxy Configuration

**Secure Proxy Usage:**
```powershell
# Use corporate proxy for traffic monitoring and compliance
$env:MSGRAPHPROXY = "http://proxy.company.com:8080"
.\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe -action getevents

# Proxy with authentication (if required)
# Configure Windows proxy settings via:
# Settings → Network & Internet → Proxy
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use HTTPS proxies when possible (tool supports HTTP/HTTPS proxy URLs)
- ✅ Monitor proxy logs for unauthorized usage
- ✅ Use authenticated proxies in enterprise environments
- ✅ Whitelist required Microsoft domains: `*.graph.microsoft.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`
- ❌ Don't bypass corporate proxy policies
- ❌ Don't disable certificate validation

---

### TLS/SSL Security

**Built-in Security:**
- ✅ All Graph API calls use HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)
- ✅ Certificate validation is enforced
- ✅ Uses Go's standard crypto libraries
- ✅ No SSL/TLS configuration needed

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Never disable certificate validation
- ❌ Never use HTTP proxies for production (use HTTPS)
- ❌ Never accept self-signed certificates in production

---

## Access Control and Operational Security

### Script Deployment

**Restrict who can execute the tool:**

```powershell
# Set file permissions (Administrators and specific users only)
$toolPath = "C:\Tools\msgraphgolangtestingtool.exe"
$acl = Get-Acl $toolPath
$acl.SetAccessRuleProtection($true, $false)  # Remove inherited permissions

# Allow Administrators
$adminRule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule(
    "BUILTIN\Administrators", "FullControl", "Allow"
)
$acl.SetAccessRule($adminRule)

# Allow specific automation account
$automationRule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule(
    "DOMAIN\AutomationAccount", "ReadAndExecute", "Allow"
)
$acl.AddAccessRule($automationRule)

Set-Acl $toolPath $acl
```

**Audit Script Execution:**
```powershell
# Enable PowerShell script block logging (Group Policy or registry)
# This logs all PowerShell commands including tool execution

# View execution audit logs
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" |
    Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*msgraphgolangtestingtool*"} |
    Select-Object TimeCreated, Message |
    Format-List
```

---

### Principle of Least Access

**Service Accounts for Automation:**
```powershell
# ✅ CORRECT - Dedicated service account
# Create dedicated Entra ID Application Registration for each automation task
# Grant only required permissions
# Monitor usage via Azure AD Sign-in logs

# ❌ WRONG - Using personal admin account
# Don't use personal accounts with elevated privileges
# Don't share credentials across multiple automations
```

**Mailbox Access Control:**
```powershell
# Limit mailbox access using Exchange Application Access Policies
Connect-ExchangeOnline

# Create dedicated security group
New-DistributionGroup -Name "Graph-Tool-Allowed-Mailboxes" -Type "Security"
Add-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Graph-Tool-Allowed-Mailboxes" -Member "automation@example.com"

# Restrict app to only access mailboxes in this group
New-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" -PolicyScopeGroupId "Graph-Tool-Allowed-Mailboxes@example.com" -AccessRight RestrictAccess

# Verify policy
Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity "automation@example.com" -AppId "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
# Should show: Access granted
Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity "random-user@example.com" -AppId "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
# Should show: Access denied
```

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Azure AD Sign-in Logs

Monitor application usage in Azure AD:

1. Navigate to: Azure Portal → Azure AD → Enterprise Applications → Your App → Sign-in logs
2. Review:
   - Sign-in frequency
   - Source IP addresses
   - Success/failure rates
   - Anomalous activity

**Set up alerts for:**
- Failed authentication attempts (potential credential compromise)
- Sign-ins from unexpected IP addresses
- High volume of API calls (potential abuse)
- Permission changes to the application

---

### Microsoft 365 Audit Logs

Track mailbox and calendar operations:

1. Navigate to: Microsoft 365 Compliance Center → Audit → Search
2. Filter by:
   - User: Your app's mailbox access
   - Activities: `Send`, `MailItemsAccessed`, `Update`, `Create`
   - Date range: Last 7-90 days

**Create alerts for:**
- Mass email sending (potential spam/phishing)
- Unusual access patterns
- Operations outside business hours

---

## Incident Response

### If Credentials are Compromised

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Revoke the compromised credential:**
   ```powershell
   # For Client Secret:
   # Azure Portal → App Registrations → Your App → Certificates & secrets → Delete secret

   # For Certificate:
   # Azure Portal → App Registrations → Your App → Certificates & secrets → Delete certificate
   ```

2. **Review audit logs for unauthorized usage:**
   ```powershell
   # Check Azure AD sign-in logs for suspicious activity
   # Check mailbox audit logs for unauthorized email sending
   ```

3. **Generate new credential:**
   ```powershell
   # Create new secret or certificate
   # Update automation scripts with new credential
   ```

4. **Notify security team and stakeholders**

5. **Document incident and lessons learned**

---

### If Malicious Activity Detected

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Revoke application permissions:**
   - Azure Portal → App Registrations → Your App → API permissions → Remove permissions

2. **Disable the application:**
   - Azure Portal → Enterprise Applications → Your App → Properties → Enabled for users to sign-in? → No

3. **Investigate scope of breach:**
   - Review all sign-in logs
   - Review all mailbox audit logs
   - Identify affected mailboxes

4. **Remediate:**
   - Recall sent emails (if applicable)
   - Delete unauthorized calendar events
   - Notify affected users

5. **Re-enable with enhanced security:**
   - New credentials
   - Restricted mailbox access policies
   - Enhanced monitoring and alerting

---

## Compliance and Data Protection

### GDPR / Data Privacy

**Personal Data Handling:**
- Email addresses are logged in CSV files
- Email subjects may contain personal data
- CSV logs stored in local temp directory (not encrypted)

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Encrypt CSV logs if they contain sensitive personal data
- ✅ Implement retention policies (delete logs after 90 days)
- ✅ Restrict access to CSV log files
- ✅ Include tool usage in data processing records (GDPR Article 30)
- ✅ Inform users if their emails are being processed by automation

---

### Regulatory Compliance

**For regulated industries (HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001):**
- Document application usage in security policies
- Include in risk assessments
- Implement change management for updates
- Conduct regular security reviews
- Maintain audit trails (Azure AD logs + CSV logs)
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS enforced, consider CSV encryption)

---
